# When Cucumber supports the English text, why do we need a separate Gherkin language?

It has been discussed several times that Cucumber supports plain English text, then why we need a separate Gherkin language. The answer to this lies in the concept of the BDD (Behavior Driven Development).<br>

As we know, BDD involves various software behavior development possibilities while preparing test scripts. These can be development-related possibilities or business-related possibilities. In order to accomplish these possibilities, we need members from different communities like testers, developers, product owners, and project managers while developing test scripts.
